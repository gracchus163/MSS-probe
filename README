Reads packets from an interface or pcapfile and records stats in a binary format.
Information recorded:
  Hashed IP
  Hashed subnet
  MSS
  Segment Size
  TCP Options order
  TCP flags
  DSCP
  Transport is TCP or UDP
  IPv4 or IPv6
  IPv4 fragment flags
  QUIC version ID
We then also record how many occurences of each MSS and DSCP in the dataset.
Recording speeds of 200MB/s with 0 packet drops is the max we have achieved on our hardware.

Indebted to libtrace [https://github.com/LibtraceTeam/libtrace]

./probe.out pcap:<pcapfile>
or
./probe.out bpf:igb0   #bsd interface named igb0
./probe.out int:eth0	#linux interface named eth0

Will produce timestamped bin files and append dropped stats to a file named "packet_stats"
Must have file named salt1 and salt2 in directory each with a 30 character string
Interface must be set to promiscuous mode

./read.out <bin_file> will print out the collected stats of every packet
Run stats.sh with a bin file as the argument will slowly process the bin file and print out stats on MSS and DSCP occurence.
./read_stats.out <bin_file> will print out the collected stats of every packet to stdout and print to stderr the MSS and DSCP occurences. Has not been tested as much but seems to work, try it first. Both provided as insurance.

If needed to compile
./mk
will compile the 3 programs on Freebsd only. some changes required for linux or maybe the compiler

TODO:
Improve performance of reading the packets
Porting to libtrace parallel may help with this (:

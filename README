Reads packets from an interface or pcapfile and records stats in a binary format.
Information recorded:
  Hashed IP
  Hashed subnet
  MSS
  Segment Size
  TCP Options order
  TCP flags
  DSCP
  Transport is TCP or UDP
  IPv4 or IPv6
  IPv4 fragment flags
  QUIC version ID
We then also record how many occurences of each MSS and DSCP in the dataset.
Recording speeds of 200MB/s with 0 packet drops is the max we have achieved on our hardware.
  

Indebted to libtrace [https://github.com/LibtraceTeam/libtrace]

./probe.out pcap:<pcapfile>
Will produce timestamped bin files
Run read_bin.out with a bin file as the argument

If needed to compile
./mk probe_bin.c
./mk read_bin.c
Must have file named salt1 and salt2 in directory each with a 30 character string
TODO:
Improve performance of reading the packets
Porting to libtrace parallel may help with this (:
